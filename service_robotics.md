# ü§ñ Service Robotics üè†

Service Robotics is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field focused on robots designed to assist humans in everyday environments, distinct from the traditional industrial robotic arms found in factories. This subject explores a broad spectrum of applications where robotic technology delivers robust and economically viable solutions, transforming many aspects of daily life and industry.

From household cleaning robots, like autonomous vacuum cleaners that have revolutionized the appliance market, to entertainment robots carving out their own niche, service robots are becoming increasingly present in daily life. The course also covers fast-growing fields such as assistive and medical robots ‚Äî including exoskeletons, surgical robots, rehabilitation aids, and companion robots ‚Äî which tackle crucial social challenges like aging populations.

Autonomous vehicles are another important topic, as they progressively master more complex driving tasks beyond isolated features such as automatic parking or highway navigation. Major automotive manufacturers and tech companies like Tesla and Google are expanding these capabilities, bringing safer and more sustainable transportation solutions closer to reality.

Additionally, service robots find applications in agriculture, mining, military missions, and rescue operations. Logistics robots that automate material handling in modern warehouses, as well as inspection and surveillance robots, also form part of this diverse field.

Two transversal themes in this area are **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** and **safety**, both essential for practical deployment of service robots in real environments.
