[Unibotics](https://unibotics.org/) is an educational web platform developed by [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/) organization. **Some teachers from our university are actually members of this organization**.

The main features that this site provides are:

- **Web based**. Uses a browser as GUI.
- **Dependencies preinstallation**. A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jderobot/robotics-backend) is provided with all necessary dependencies, which will serve as robotics backend.
- **Python language**.
- **ROS2 Based**.
**Simulated + real robots**. The platform is capable of program real robots.
- **Academy**. A series of practical challenges are proposed.
- **Games**. You can compete with other programmers as a evaluation system is implemented within the exercises.
- **Forum**. The site also provides a _forum_ where you can discourse about the platform, the exercises...

The entire practical part of the subject is based on the platform. To get it working you only need to sign up!
